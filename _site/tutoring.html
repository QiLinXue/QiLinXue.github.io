<h2>math</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Kindergarten to Grade 3</strong>  — In this developmental stage, I will <strong><em>develop a strong foundation</em></strong> through creative and personalized methods to ensure your child will <strong><em>enjoy math</em></strong></li>
  <li><strong>Grade 4 - Grade 8</strong> — I will assist students to understand the <strong><em>core concepts,</em></strong> which will make it extremely easy to transition into high school.</li>
  <li><strong>High School (Algebra - Calculus I)</strong> — This is the stage that causes students the most anguish, but I will help you see the <strong><em>beauty and intuition</em></strong> behind these seemingly confusing equations. I will focus on answering not only <em>what</em> and <em>how</em>, but also <em>why</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Math Contest Preparation (all ages)</strong> — I will help aspiring students and give them the tools required to develop <strong><em>strong problem solving skills</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>physics</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mechanics (Kinematics, Newton’s Laws, Circular Motion, Gravitation)</strong> — I will foster intuition, and build a rich understanding. I will focus on emphasizing practical and real life applications and examples by drawing connections in the everyday world.</li>
</ul>
