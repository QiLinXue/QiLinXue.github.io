      <h1>Physics</h1>
      Since mid-2019, I've been obsessed with physics. Here are some of my personal projects and achievements: <br><br> 
      <div class="row-md">
        <h3>üìúPUEC: Orbital Resonance Model</h3>
        <p>          
          As part of a challenge offered by <i>Physics Unlimited</i>, a few friends and I wrote a <a href=links/resonance.pdf>paper</a> that discussed techniques to model stable and unstable orbital resonances in the solar system. We expanded upon prior work to develop a better model of libration period in stable first order resonant systems and created an accurate model to predict the strengths of Kirkwood gaps.

        <h3>ü•àTJPhO: Second</h3>
        <p>          
          I participated in the <a href="https://tjphysicsolympiad.com/">Thomas Jefferson Physics Olympiad</a> in a team of three. We came second overall and won $600 total. The 11 problems revolved around black hole physics. This included investigating black hole thermodynamics through Hawking radiation and deriving the Schwarzchild matrix with tensor calculus.

        <h3>ü•áMcMaster Physics Contest: First</h3>
        <p>          
          I participated in the McMaster Physics Contest, an online one-hour multiple choice exam. My partner and I tied for first place and won the $100 prize.

        <h3>‚öõÔ∏è BL4S CERN Competition: Shortlist</h3>
        <p>          
          My team-mates and I designed a particle physics experiment to examine the effects of bond length during electron channeling in specific crystals. Organized by CERN and DESY, we were shortlisted out of hundreds of participating teams. We received Cosmic Pi particle detectors as prizes and the top two teams are still to be decided.

        <h3>üèÜ OPhO Organizer</h3>
        <p>          
          I started, organized, and wrote problems for the <a href="http://opho.physoly.tech/">Online Physics Olympiad</a> (OPhO), an annual competition with 300+ teams from 40+ countries competing in a fast paced live tournament for thousands of dollars in prizes.

        <h3>üë®‚Äçüè´ PhysOlymp Curriculum Developer</h3>
        <p>          
          I developed chapters, wrote problems and solutions for the iOS and Android app PhysOlymp, a physics olympiad app that prepares students for various national and international physics competitions.

        <h3>üìùPhysics Brawl: 35th</h3>
        <p>          
          My team-mates and I came 35th in the highest division in this 3 hour long online physics marathon. We were the only team with students from different countries (and different schools!) so effective communication was difficult. Nevertheless it was a lot of fun and we all learned a lot.

        <h3>üîóPhysics Olympiad Discord Server</h3>
        <p>          
          I run the largest online physics olympiad server. Our community has over 400 members from around the world. I select daily problems to post from a variety of sources as well as write original weekly challenges.

        <h3>‚Äé‚Äçüè´Physics Club Founder</h3>
        <p>          
          I founded the Physics Club at my school. We prepare and deliver lectures on physics topics outside the scope of the Ontario curriculum, yet not too difficult. Fluid statics and dynamics, thermodynamics, dimensional analysis, and other topics were taught.
