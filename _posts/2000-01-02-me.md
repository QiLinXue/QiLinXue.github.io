# am i a cyborg?

No. (but that's what a robot would like you to think)

In my spare time, other than ~~recharging my batteries~~ I read, I play sports, and I occupy myself by learning something new.

I'm also the head of HR and acting vice-chair of a youth run organization [Volunteering Peel](https://volunteeringpeel.org). As you can guess, I thoroughly enjoy volunteering, talking with others, and helping people out.
