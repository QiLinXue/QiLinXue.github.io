## some cool stuff I made

- ***Chess Engine*** One of my first ever projects written in a java-based language called [processing](https://processing.org), I've created a simple chess engine where you can play against yourself and a really simple CPU. The code is very ugly, so *please do not check the source code.* I promise I'm better now. You can view it [here](../projects/Chess_Engine/chess.html) (press space for the cpu to move)
